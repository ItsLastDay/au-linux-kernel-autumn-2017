# AU Programming in Linux Kernel course

I studied programming in kernelspace: 
- implemented a driver for virtual storage device (read\write\open\close\ioctl\mmap\asynchronous write\nonblocking read-write) - see `tasks/vsd*` folders;
- wrote a simple (but buggy) [futex](https://github.com/ItsLastDay/au-linux-kernel-autumn-2017/blob/master/tasks/mutex/mutex_module/module.c).
